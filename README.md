# WARNING: THIS CODE IS BAD AND OBSOLETE !!!

This is the first and only codebase of eqMac1 when it was released nearly two years ago.
Back then I was still learning and was a crap developer all around.

This repo only exists to help other developers figure out how it works, as since I released eqMac1, many developers kept asking questions on how it worked. Please don't submit Pull Requests, but if you have any developer questions hit me up on Twitter: @RomanBitgapp. 
Use this code in whatever way you wish.
